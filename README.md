#How to Code for this Repo
Option A: Fork, Edit, then Pull Request when ready.
Option B: If in the CC4C Brigade, Develop/test in your own branch, preferablly a feature-named-branch, and once it's ready for production, merge into gh-pages, which auto deploys to GitHub pages for codeforvirginiabeach.org

Also, it's nice if you merge/commit to gh-pages, that you [let the team know on our Google Group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/colorado-code-for-communities).
